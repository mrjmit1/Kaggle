# Kaggle Projects Repository
Welcome to my Kaggle Projects repository! This repository contains solutions, notebooks, and insights for two popular Kaggle competitions: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques and Spaceship Titanic. Below is an overview of each project.

#Projects Overview
1. House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
üè† Problem Description
This competition aims to predict the final price of homes based on various features. This project focuses on advanced regression techniques to accurately estimate house prices using a variety of features such as location, size, and condition.

üìã Key Steps:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Model Selection and Tuning (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Etc.)
Performance Evaluation (e.g., MSE)

2. Spaceship Titanic
üöÄ Problem Description
The challenge is to predict whether passengers survived the collision of the Spaceship Titanic, based on their demographics, travel class, and other attributes.

üìã Key Steps:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data
Feature Engineering (e.g., Grouping passengers by cabin)
Classification Model Training (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
Evaluation Metrics (e.g., Accuracy)
